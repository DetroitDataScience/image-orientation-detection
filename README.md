# Image Orientation Detection
A presentation and exercise designed as an introduction into machine learning.  Presented at the [Detroit Data Science Meetup on 3/30/2018](https://www.meetup.com/Detroit-Data-Science-Meetup/events/238413214/).

# Getting Started

1. You do not need the training and test data to get started.  Go ahead and clone the repository without the submodules:

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:DetroitDataScience/image-orientation-detection.git
    ```

    > Note: You can use the following command to download the training and test data `git submodule update --init --recursive` 

2. Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you do not already have it.  You can run `python --version` to see if python is already installed.
